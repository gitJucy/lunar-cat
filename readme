I have never had the opportunity to work with drag and drop before this exercise.  
Some of the remnants of my experiments are still sitting in the imports for the project at this point.  

When I was unable to access data the first time through, I decided to frame out the components 
of my app to make further work easier.  If I were to attempt a project like this again I would build 
components based around the React DnD library by Dan Abramov as it seem to be the most complete without making too many 
assumptions about the type of function you need.  Incorporating it into a pre-existing set of components was painful.

This app is meant to be viewed at 100% in a browser and does not play well with responsiveness by design.

I decided it would be better to get this in your hands quickly rather than finish the last 
scrappy bits of what I was working on and go down the road of re-building the app from scratch to incorporate 
a different library based approach to functionality.  I know you are looking for hands on the keys sooner rather than later!
I hope you can see the direction I was heading and hope I get the opportunity to 
contribute with you in the future.

Cheers,
John Lucy
